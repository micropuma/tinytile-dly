# TinyTile: A TileAndFuse Tutorial

This repository contains code accompanied along with the tutorial ["An Introduction to Tensor Tiling in MLIR" given at EuroLLVM 2025](https://youtu.be/FLEb30WyroA?si=BBXuJofubQ_WpMIU).

This repository was forked from the tutorial source code, but adds the following improvements:   
* More structured MLIR codes
* Some useful MLIR components added for Debugging and practice   
    1. MLIR listener mechanism, refer to `include/DimListener.h`
